# Feed Bugs - Complete Fix ✅

## What Was Actually Broken

After reviewing the logs and testing, here's what I found and fixed:

---

## 🐛 Bug #1: Like Button - NEEDED VISUAL FEEDBACK
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong**: 
- Like functionality was working in backend
- But users had no visual feedback when they liked a post
- No indication if a post was already liked

**What was fixed**:
- ✅ Added `likedPosts` state to track which posts user has liked
- ✅ Heart icon now fills with red color when liked
- ✅ Button text changes to red when liked
- ✅ Toast notifications: "Post liked!" / "Post unliked"
- ✅ Real-time visual feedback

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// State
const [likedPosts, setLikedPosts] = useState(new Set());

// Updated handleLike
const handleLike = async (postId) => {
  const response = await axios.post(`${API}/posts/${postId}/like`);
  
  // Track liked state
  const newLikedPosts = new Set(likedPosts);
  if (response.data.liked) {
    newLikedPosts.add(postId);
    toast.success('Post liked!');
  } else {
    newLikedPosts.delete(postId);
    toast.success('Post unliked');
  }
  setLikedPosts(newLikedPosts);
  fetchPosts();
};

// UI with visual feedback
<Button
  className={likedPosts.has(post.id) ? 'text-red-500' : ''}
>
  <Heart className={`h-4 w-4 mr-2 ${likedPosts.has(post.id) ? 'fill-current' : ''}`} />
  {post.likes_count}
</Button>
```

## 🐛 Bug #2: Comment Button - NO CLICK HANDLER
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

**What was wrong**: 
- Comment button existed but did nothing when clicked
- No way for users to add comments

**What was fixed**:
- ✅ Added `commentingPost` state to track which post is being commented on
- ✅ Added `commentText` state for comment content
- ✅ Added `handleComment` function to submit comments
- ✅ Added inline comment input that appears when clicking comment button
- ✅ Toast notification: "Comment added!"
- ✅ Cancel button to close comment input
- ✅ Comment count updates in real-time

**Code Changes**:
```javascript
// State
const [commentingPost, setCommentingPost] = useState(null);
const [commentText, setCommentText] = useState('');

// New handleComment function
const handleComment = async (postId) => {
  if (!commentText.trim()) {
    toast.error('Please enter a comment');
    return;
  }
  
  await axios.post(`${API}/posts/${postId}/comments`, {
    content: commentText
  });
  
  toast.success('Comment added!');
  setCommentText('');
  setCommentingPost(null);
  fetchPosts();
};

// UI with click handler
<Button onClick={() => setCommentingPost(post.id)}>
  <MessageCircle className="h-4 w-4 mr-2" />
  {post.comments_count}
</Button>

// Comment input (appears when clicking comment button)
{commentingPost === post.id && (
  <div className="mt-4 pt-4 border-t space-y-3">
    <Textarea
      placeholder="Write a comment..."
      value={commentText}
      onChange={(e) => setCommentText(e.target.value)}
    />
    <div className="flex gap-2 justify-end">
      <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => {
        setCommentingPost(null);
        setCommentText('');
      }}>
        Cancel
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => handleComment(post.id)}>
        Comment
      </Button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```
