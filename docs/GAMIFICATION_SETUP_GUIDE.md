## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Schema Setup

You need to execute the new database schema in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `/app/backend/gamification_schema.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute the schema

This will create all necessary tables:
- `leaderboards` - Rankings for volunteers, donors, NGOs
- `badges` - Available achievement badges
- `user_badges` - Badges earned by users
- `challenges` - Community challenges
- `challenge_participants` - Challenge participation tracking
- `activity_streaks` - User activity streaks
- `community_scores` - Overall impact scores
- `live_counters` - Real-time counters
- `impact_events` - Events for timeline and map
- `impact_heatmap` - Heatmap data
- `impact_roi` - ROI calculations
- `analytics_predictions` - Predictive analytics data
- `comparative_metrics` - Comparative analytics
- `impact_multipliers` - Multiplier effects
- `sustainability_metrics` - Environmental impact

The schema also includes:
- 11 pre-configured achievement badges
- 8 live counters initialized
- Automatic ranking functions
- Triggers for real-time updates

### Step 2: Backend Verification

The backend endpoints are already added. Verify they're working:

```bash
# Check backend status
sudo supervisorctl status backend

# Test a gamification endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/gamification/badges

# Test a real-time endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/realtime/counters

# Test an analytics endpoint (requires auth)
curl http://localhost:8001/api/analytics/sustainability
```

---

### Step 3: Frontend Access

The new features are accessible at:
- **Main Page**: http://your-domain/impact-hub

The Impact Hub has three tabs:
1. **Gamification Tab**: Leaderboards, Badges, Challenges, Streaks
2. **Real-time Impact Tab**: Live counters, maps, heatmaps, donation ticker
3. **Analytics Tab**: ROI calculator, predictions, comparisons

You'll also see a new **"Impact Hub"** link in the navigation bar (highlighted in blue/purple gradient).

ws://your-domain/ws/{user_id}

// Message types:
- counter_update: Live counter updates
- new_challenge: New challenge created
- challenge_completed: Challenge completed
- badge_earned: User earned a badge
- new_impact_event: New impact event for timeline
- new_donation: New donation for ticker
```

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Execute the database schema** in Supabase
2. **Test the /impact-hub page** in your browser
3. **Create some test data**:
   - Volunteer for events to update leaderboards
   - Make donations to see donation ticker
   - Create challenges for users to join
4. **Monitor WebSocket connections** for real-time updates
5. **Customize** badges, challenges, and analytics as needed

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Maps not loading?**
- Check console for Leaflet errors
- Ensure internet connection for OpenStreetMap tiles

**WebSocket not connecting?**
- Verify WebSocket URL in components
- Check backend WebSocket endpoint: `ws://your-domain/ws/{user_id}`

**Badges not showing?**
- Verify database schema was executed
- Check if badges table has data

**Real-time updates not working?**
- Check WebSocket connection in browser console
- Verify backend is broadcasting events

---

## üìä Performance Notes

- Maps and heatmaps load on-demand
- WebSocket connections are managed per user
- Leaderboard rankings update automatically via database triggers
- Live counters cache for 1 minute to reduce database load

## üé® Customization

### Add New Badges
```sql
INSERT INTO badges (badge_name, badge_description, badge_icon, badge_type, criteria, rarity, points)
VALUES ('Your Badge', 'Description', 'üèÖ', 'custom', '{"requirement": "value"}'::jsonb, 'rare', 50);
```

### Add New Live Counters
```sql
INSERT INTO live_counters (counter_name, counter_value, counter_type)
VALUES ('custom_metric', 0, 'impact');
```

### Create Custom Challenges
Use the POST /api/gamification/challenges endpoint or create directly in database.
