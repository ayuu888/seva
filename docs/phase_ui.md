## üìù Implementation Guidelines

### Animation Principles:
1. **No jarring movements**: Use scale, opacity, and subtle lifts
2. **Consistent timing**: 200ms for micro, 300-400ms for normal, 600ms+ for dramatic
3. **Easing**: Use easeInOut for most, easeOut for entrances, easeIn for exits
4. **Purpose**: Every animation should serve a purpose (feedback, guidance, delight)

### Spacing Rules:
1. **Consistent gaps**: Use 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24 for spacing
2. **Full width utilization**: Ensure no wasted space on large screens
3. **Breathing room**: Don't overcrowd elements
4. **Responsive spacing**: Reduce on mobile, increase on desktop

### Color Usage:
1. **Gradients**: Purple-blue for primary, pink-purple for accents
2. **Glass morphism**: white/20 borders, backdrop-blur
3. **Shadows**: Subtle shadows, enhance on hover
4. **Contrast**: Ensure text is always readable

### Component Patterns:
1. **Cards**: Rounded-xl, border-white/20, shadow-lg, hover:shadow-2xl
2. **Buttons**: Rounded-full, proper padding, clear states
3. **Inputs**: Rounded-xl, glass-input, border-white/20
4. **Modals**: Centered, glass-card-strong, smooth transitions

## üöÄ Quick Reference: Common Patterns

### Animation Pattern:
```javascript
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.4 }}
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.02, y: -5 }}
>
```

### Card Pattern:
```javascript
<Card className="glass-card-strong border-white/20 shadow-lg hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300">
```

### Background Orbs Pattern:
```javascript
<div className="fixed inset-0 overflow-hidden pointer-events-none">
  <motion.div
    className="absolute w-96 h-96 bg-gradient-to-br from-purple-400/15 to-pink-400/15 rounded-full blur-3xl"
    animate={{ scale: [1, 1.2, 1], opacity: [0.2, 0.4, 0.2] }}
    transition={{ duration: 10, repeat: Infinity, ease: "easeInOut" }}
  />
</div>
```

### Button Pattern:
```javascript
<Button className="rounded-full px-6 py-2 hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-200">
```
