## üìä How to Populate Database with Seed Data

### Option 1: Use Simple Seed Data (Recommended for Testing)
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Open file: `/home/iambatman/dev/seva/docs/simple_seed_data.sql`
4. Copy all contents and paste into SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute

This will add:
- 2 sample users with avatars
- 3 sample NGOs with descriptions
- Multiple sample events
- Basic data to test the Feed

### Option 2: Use Comprehensive Seed Data
1. Open: `/home/iambatman/dev/seva/docs/comprehensive_seed_data.sql`

## üêõ Known Issues & Next Steps

### Backend Port Conflict
- **Issue**: Port 8001 is currently in use
- **Solution**: Either:

### Frontend Port
- **Note**: Frontend is running on port 3001 instead of 3000
- Update API URL if needed in frontend `.env` file

### Database Population
- **Action Needed**: Run seed data script in Supabase to populate the Feed with posts
- **File**: `/home/iambatman/dev/seva/docs/simple_seed_data.sql`
